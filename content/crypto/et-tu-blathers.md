This is my first ctf writeup. How *exciting*! This problem is a warmup crypto question on Vigenere cipher.

## Problem
Et tu Mr. Mayor?! Mr mayor is eating his salad and he has a good 'Vigenerete' dressing. He is also trying to read his email, but something is wrong with the first line of this file... I think it is encoded! Can you decrypt it?

Wrap your result in uiuctf{}
